What might be implications for studying digital autonomy?\n- Can you think of examples that are similar to the empirical studies described in the chapter, but relate to digital media use?\n- Did you find anything odd while reading the chapter? Can you identify aspects that might be worthy of critique?\n\n\n# References\n\n",
